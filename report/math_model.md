# Description
The mathematical model of the static bending equation is given by
$$
    (EIw'')''(x) = q(x),\hspace{0.5cm}x\in\Omega
$$
where the domain $\Omega = [0,L]$ is one-dimensional and $L$ is the length of the beam. Specifically we have
* $w(x)$: height of the neutral axis (bending curve) at x
* $E(x)$: Young's modulus
* $I(x)$: area moment of inertia
* $q(x)$: load at x
In addition,
* $M(x) = EIw''(x)$: bending moment at x
* $Q(x) = -(EIw'')'(x)$: shear force at x
can be used for setting the boundary conditions, influencing the bending curve.
